ðŸ”¹ Pages & Classes

TempPage â€“ Code-Pega-List

What: A page of type Code-Pega-List, the generic list structure in Pega that holds multiple results from an Obj-Browse.

Why: Obj-Browse always returns results in a list format (pxResults). This lets you loop through those results.

How: You defined TempPage in Pages & Classes to be Code-Pega-List so it can legally hold query results.

TempPage.pxResults â€“ Rule-RuleSet-Branch

What: Each row (pxResults(n)) will be of class Rule-RuleSet-Branch.

Why: Because you are browsing the Rule-RuleSet-Branch class (branches). Each branch is represented as a row.

How: By mapping pxResults to this class, Pega lets you access branch-specific properties like .pyBranchID and .pzInsKey.

ðŸ”¹ Step 1 â€” Obj-Browse (TempPage)

What: Queries the database table for all instances of Rule-RuleSet-Branch (branches).

Why: You need a list of all branches to evaluate which ones are empty.

How:

PageName: TempPage â†’ results go into TempPage.

ObjClass: Rule-RuleSet-Branch â†’ you are querying branch instances.

MaxRecords: 100 â†’ limits results for safety (avoid huge fetch).

GetRowKey: pzInsKey â†’ fetches each branchâ€™s unique key.

Properties selected (pzInsKey, pyBranchID) â†’ only retrieves what you need instead of full rows, for performance.

ðŸ‘‰ End result: TempPage.pxResults() contains all the branches.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2 â€” Loop over TempPage.pxResults

What: Iterates through each branch row.

Why: You need to check each branch individually.

How: Loop type = For each embedded page on TempPage.pxResults. That means .pyBranchID or .pzInsKey are accessible for the current branch.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2.1 â€” Property-Set

What: Copies .pyBranchID into a parameter.

Why: The data page D_pzBranchContent needs branchID as input to check if rules exist. By setting Param.BranchID = .pyBranchID, you prepare that input.

How:

Param.BranchID â†’ temporary parameter variable in the activity.

.pyBranchID â†’ property in current loop branch record.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2.2 â€” Call pxDeleteBranch (conditional)

What: Calls the OOTB activity pxDeleteBranch to delete the branch.

Why: This is the official safe way to delete a branch in Pega.

How:

When condition â†’ @LengthOfPageList(D_pzBranchContent[branchID:Param.BranchID].pxResults) = 0

This loads the OOTB data page D_pzBranchContent for the current branch.

.pxResults is the list of rules inside that branch.

If the count is 0, the branch is empty.

If true â†’ continue â†’ executes delete.

If false â†’ skip step â†’ branch is not deleted.

âœ… Why this works better than the long approach

You avoided juggling multiple nested loops, custom counters, and handling RSVs.

You directly leveraged D_pzBranchContent (OOTB data page) to check content, instead of manually browsing RSVs and rules.

You used pxDeleteBranch (OOTB safe delete method), so you donâ€™t need to mess with Obj-Delete/Obj-Save on Application records.

ðŸ”Ž In simple words:

Step 1: Get all branches.

Step 2: Loop through each branch.

Step 2.1: Save the branch ID into a param.

Step 2.2: If no rules exist in that branch (D_pzBranchContent empty), delete the branch.
